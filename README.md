# Bakery Sales Analytics

# AI Implementation for Small Bakery Businesses in France

## Project Overview

Small businesses, such as local bakeries, face challenges in adopting AI solutions despite global advancements. Limited awareness, resources, and tailored tools slow down AI implementation.

This project focuses on developing an accessible AI-powered sales analysis and demand forecasting tool specifically designed for small bakeries. Using real sales data, we help bakery owners optimize inventory, plan purchases, and improve profitability by understanding customer demand patterns.

## Key Challenges Addressed

- Slow AI implementation in small and local businesses  
- Lack of practical, easy-to-use AI tools for sales and inventory management  
- Need for context-aware solutions tailored to local economic realities  

## Our Approach

- Analyze historical bakery sales data (products, quantities, prices, timestamps)  
- Identify demand trends, peak hours, and seasonal variations  
- Detect product substitution patterns (e.g., if demand for baguettes drops, does croissant sales rise?)  
- Segment products by price categories (cheap, medium, expensive) to optimize stock  
- Generate actionable purchase plans considering budget and storage constraints  
- Build user-friendly frontend and backend for bakery owners without AI expertise
