## Smart Sales Insights Platform

## AI-Powered Forecasting & Analytics for Small Businesses

## Project Overview
Many small and local businesses struggle to adopt AI technologies due to limited resources, technical barriers, and a lack of practical tools. Our platform is designed to bridge that gap by providing accessible and context-aware sales analysis and forecasting powered by machine learning.

We start by working with a bakery sales dataset to showcase our system, but the platform is adaptable to various types of retail and product-based businesses.

## Key Challenges We Address
Slow adoption of AI in small/local enterprises

Limited tools for non-technical users to benefit from sales forecasting

Lack of AI systems tailored to real-world constraints (budgets, storage, local demand)

## Our Approach
Use real sales data to analyze trends, peaks, and seasonal patterns

Forecast demand based on product sales, time, and behavior patterns

Segment products (e.g. by price: low, mid, high) for better stock planning

Detect cross-product relationships (e.g. substitution effects)

Provide actionable inventory and purchasing recommendations

Offer a simple frontend/backend interface for business owners

## Project Components
Data Preprocessing: Clean, standardize, and prepare real-world CSV data

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize trends, product demand, and behavior

Machine Learning: Forecast sales volume using time series models

Web Application: Upload sales data, view analytics, and download insights

Documentation: Help guides and examples for small businesses

## Current Dataset Example
We're currently demonstrating our platform using a bakery sales dataset (including timestamps, product names, quantities, and prices). This allows us to validate our models and interfaces before expanding to more business domains.
